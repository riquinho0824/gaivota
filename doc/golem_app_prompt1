I’m building a Shiny application using the golem framework in R, and I want guidance that assumes the following context and decisions have already been made:

ARCHITECTURE & GOALS
- I am using golem (package-based Shiny app).
- I have a separate R project using targets that builds data marts.
- The golem app is read-only and consumes outputs from those marts.
- Data marts are mainly Parquet (split by year/group) plus some derived metadata.
- I want clean separation between:
  - data engineering (targets project)
  - application/UI logic (golem project)

DEPLOYMENT CONSTRAINTS
- The app is deployed to Posit Connect.
- Posit deploys only code, not arbitrary external data.
- I do NOT have permission to copy data into the Posit server filesystem.
- Therefore, I may need to:
  - Either consume externally published data (if available)
  - Or bundle a ≤100 MB snapshot of the data inside the app

DATA STRATEGY (CURRENT DECISION)
- For now, I am using a SNAPSHOT approach:
  - Data is bundled inside the golem project under `inst/extdata/`
  - This makes the app a “snapshot-in-time” application
  - Updates require redeploying the app
- I understand that `inst/` is always bundled during deploy because golem apps are installed as R packages.
- I access bundled data via `system.file("extdata", package = golem::get_golem_name())`
- I do NOT write to this data at runtime.

OPTIONAL FUTURE STRATEGY
- I may later support external data via environment variables (e.g. ASSET_DATA_ROOT),
  with snapshot data as a fallback.

CODE ORGANIZATION RULES (IMPORTANT)
- All R code must live in a FLAT `R/` directory.
- Subdirectories under `R/` are NOT supported by R package namespaces.
- No `source()` hacks for production code.
- Functions must be:
  - Defined in files directly under `R/`
  - Properly exported with roxygen2 if used across files
  - Available in the package namespace after `devtools::document()` + `load_all()`

MODULE DESIGN
- I am using golem modules.
- A module does NOT have to equal a tab.
- A single domain (e.g. “asset”) may:
  - Have multiple plots and tables
  - Be rendered in multiple tabs
  - Share data logic and rendering helpers
- I typically define:
  - mod_asset_ui()
  - mod_asset_server()
  in a single file (e.g. R/mod_asset.R)
- Helper functions for data access or plotting live in separate R files (flat structure).

DATA ACCESS LAYER (DAL)
- I use DAL-style functions like:
  - read_asset_metadata()
  - read_asset_parquet()
- These functions are pure readers and do not load data at file parse time.
- Data is loaded in `app_server()` and passed to modules.

TECH STACK
- R, golem, Shiny
- targets (separate project)
- Arrow (Parquet)
- jsonlite (JSON metadata)
- Posit Connect

WHAT I WANT FROM YOU
- Assume all of the above context.
- Give production-grade advice.
- Prefer standard R / Posit / golem best practices.
- Help me with:
  - Module structure
  - Data loading patterns
  - UI composition
  - Reusability of plots/tables across tabs
  - Deployment-safe patterns
  - Dev vs prod considerations

Please continue helping me design, refine, and scale this golem application under these constraints.
